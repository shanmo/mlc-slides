# Motivation 

- Increasing need to deploy AI to end devices 
    - Self-driving car 
    - Smart home devices 
    - Smartphones 

- Deploy trained NN models can be challenging 
    - variations in hardware, e.g. ARM, x86, GPU, FPGA  
    - diversities in the OS, e.g. Windows, Ubuntu, Mac 
    - different accelerators, e.g. `TVM`, Tensor-RT, XLA OpenVino
